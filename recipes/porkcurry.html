  <p>Easy to make curry with tender pork shoulder. Beautiful.</p>
  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>1 kg pork shoulder or leg, diced</li>
    <li>½ cup chopped onions</li>
    <li>3 garlic cloves chopped</li>
    <li>1 inch fresh ginger chopped</li>
    <li>½ teaspoon ground turmeric</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon ground coriander</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon garam masala</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon red chili powder/li>
    <li>¼ cup coconut slices</li>
  </ul>

  <ol>
    <li>Place pork, sliced onions, garlic, ginger, ground turmeric, ground coriander, garam masala, red chili powder and coconut slices (if using) in a pressure cooker. Toss to coat pork in the ground spices. Season with salt. Cover the pressure cooker, and cook for about 5-6 whistles.</li>
    <li>Alternatively, you can cook pork over the stove top. Place all the ingredients in a large pan. Pour in 1 ½ cups water. Cook over medium-high heat for about one hour or until pork is tender and cooked through.</li>
    <li>To make the tempered spices, heat oil in a large frying pan over medium-high heat. Stir fry bay leaves, cinnamon stick and fennel seeds.</li>
    <li>Add onions, and sauté, stirring occasionally, for about 2-3 minutes or until browned. Add ground turmeric, ground coriander, garam masala and red chili powder. Stir fry for 1 minute.</li>
    <li>Add enough water (½ -¾ cup) to make thick sauce. Season with salt. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer for 3-4 minutes.</li>
    </li>
    <li>Add cooked pork and chopped coriander (cilantro) leaves. Simmer for another 3-4 minutes.</li>
